# Analyzing Financial Records and Votes

There are two parts to this project - PyBank and PyPoll. 

## Tools used in this project
1. Python
   Libraries:
   - Pandas
   - Numpy
   - Requests
   - OS
2. Visual Studio Code

## PyBank
The purpose of PyBank is to analyse the financial records of a company. financial data is given on a csv file. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. So, the goal is to write a python script to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
The output is supposed to be printed on the console and also saved to a text file.

### Instructions
1. To run this code, ensure that all the above libraries are installed in your environment.
2. Open the terminal on the PyBank folder on your computer.
3. Run python Pybank.py

*******PyPoll*******
In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. 
The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. I created a Python script that analyzed the votes to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes

- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

My final script can print the analysis to the terminal and can also export a text file with the results. The text file is named Pypoll_Analysis.txt, which is saved in the Analysis folder. The csv file (election_data.csv) for this challenge is saved in the Resources folder. 
The Python script, Resources folder, and the Analysis folder for this challenge are saved in PyPoll folder.
