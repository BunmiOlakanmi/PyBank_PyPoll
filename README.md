# Analyzing Financial Records and Votes

There are two parts to this project - PyBank and PyPoll. 

## Tools used in this project
   1. Python
      Libraries:
      - csv
      - OS
   2. Visual Studio Code

## PyBank
The purpose of PyBank is to analyse the financial records of a company. financial data is given on a csv file. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. So, the goal is to write a python script to calculate each of the following:
   - The total number of months included in the dataset
   - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
   - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
   - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
   - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
The output is supposed to be printed on the console and also saved to a text file.

### Instructions
1. To run this code, ensure that all the above libraries are installed in your environment.
2. Open the terminal on the PyBank folder on your computer.
3. Run python Pybank.py 

### File Description

## PyPoll

The purpose of PyPoll is to help a small, rural town modernize their vote counting process, using their poll data. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. The goal is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes, and can calculate each of the following:

   - The percentage of votes each candidate won
   - The total number of votes each candidate won
   - The winner of the election based on popular vote

### Instructions
1. To run this code, ensure that all the above libraries are installed in your environment.
2. Open the terminal on the PyBank folder on your computer.
3. Run python PyPoll.py 

### File Description

1. PyPoll folder contains PyPoll.py file, Resources and Analysis folders. 
2. PyPoll.py file contains the necessary code to analyse the votes of the town.
3. Resources folder contains the election_data.csv file, which contains the data used for the analysis.
