# python-challenge
There are two parts to this challenge - PyBank and PyPoll

******PyBank******
In this challenge, I created a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. The financial data given is called budget_data.csv. 
The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. So, I created a Python script that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

My final script can print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results. The text file is named web_final.txt
The Python script, csv file and output text file for this challenge are saved in PyBank folder. 




 

*******PyPoll*******
In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. 
The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. I created a Python script that analyzed the votes to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

My final script can print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results. The text file is named web_final.txt
The Python script, csv file and output text file for this challenge are saved in PyPoll folder.
