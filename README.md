There are two parts to this challenge - PyBank and PyPoll

******PyBank*******
In this challenge, I created a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. The financial data given is called budget_data.csv. 
The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. So, I create a Python script that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
