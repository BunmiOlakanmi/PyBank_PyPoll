# Analyzing Financial Records and Votes

There are two parts to this project - PyBank and PyPoll. 

## Tools used in this project
1. Python
   Libraries:
   - Pandas
   - Numpy
   - Requests
   - OS

## PyBank
The purpose of PyBank is to analyse the financial records of a company. financial data is given on a csv file. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. So, the goal is to write a python script to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
The output is supposed to be printed on the console and also saved to a text file.





******PyBank******
In this challenge, I created a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. The financial data given is called budget_data.csv. 
The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. So, I created a Python script that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

My final script can print the analysis to the terminal and can also export a text file with the results. The text file is named PyBank_Analysis.txt, which is saved in the Analysis folder. The csv file (budget_data.csv) for this challenge is saved in the Resources folder.
The Python script, Resources folder and the Analysis folder for this challenge are saved in PyBank folder. 


 

*******PyPoll*******
In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. 
The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. I created a Python script that analyzed the votes to calculate each of the following:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

My final script can print the analysis to the terminal and can also export a text file with the results. The text file is named Pypoll_Analysis.txt, which is saved in the Analysis folder. The csv file (election_data.csv) for this challenge is saved in the Resources folder. 
The Python script, Resources folder, and the Analysis folder for this challenge are saved in PyPoll folder.
